#Media organizer written in python

It is a simple program that organizes your images and videos
by modification time.
This program creates a folder for each modification time of files
you have and in each folder you will have "photos" and "videos"
folder.

You can run it in windows/mac/linux like:
1. open cmd
2. windows :
   ```cmd
   $ python media_organizer.py src_folder_path dest_folder_path
   ```
   linux/mac :
   ```bash
   $ python3 media_organizer.py src_folder_path dest_folder_path
   ```
3. click enter

Actually this is my first project on github :).
